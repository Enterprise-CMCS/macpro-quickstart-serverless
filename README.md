# macpro-quickstart-serverless ![Build](https://github.com/CMSgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)[![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cmsgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless.svg)](https://github.com/cmsgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless/releases/latest)

A serverless form submission application built and deployed to AWS with the Serverless Application Framework.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./.images/architecture.png?raw=true)

## Local Dev

Run all the services locally with the command `./dev local`

See the Requirements section if the command asks for any prerequisites you don't have installed.

Local dev is configured in typescript project in `./src`. The entrypoint is `./src/dev.ts`, it manages running the moving pieces locally: the API, the database, the filestore, and the frontend.

Local dev is built around the Serverless plugin [`serverless-offline`](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline). `serverless-offline` runs an API gateway locally configured by `./services/app-api/serverless.yml` and hot reloads your lambdas on every save. The plugins [`serverless-dynamodb-local`](https://github.com/99x/serverless-dynamodb-local) and [`serverless-s3-local`](https://github.com/ar90n/serverless-s3-local) stand up the local db and local s3 in a similar fashion.

When run locally, auth bypasses Cognito. The frontend mimics login in local storage with a mock user and sends an id in the `cognito-identity-id` header on every request. `serverless-offline` expects that and sets it as the cognitoId in the requestContext for your lambdas, just like Cognito would in AWS.

## Usage

## Requirements

Node - we enforce using a specific version of node, specified in the file `.nvmrc`. This version matches the Lambda runtime. We recommend managing node versions using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Serverless - Get help installing it here: [Serverless Getting Started page](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

Yarn - in order to install dependencies, you need to [install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

AWS Account: You'll need an AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions (admin recommended) to deploy this app in Amazon.

If you are on a Mac, you should be able to install all the dependencies like so:

```
# install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash

# select the version specified in .nvmrc
nvm install
nvm use

# install yarn
brew install yarn

# run dev
./dev local
```

## Dependencies

None.

## Examples

None.
